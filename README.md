# BST-implementation

Hi there, this is Musiur Alam Opu from Bangladesh.
I am a full stack web developer.
I love code in an efficient way and the way of implementing that is DATA STRUCTURE and ALGORITHM...

Here I did \***_Taking the graph as input_** \***_BFS(Breath First Search) Algorithm_** \***_DFS(Depth First Search) Algorithm_** \***_Finding neighbour_** \***_Testing simple project_**

**_BST(Binary Search Tree)_**
'Preorder, Inorder ,Postorder traversal algorithm'
'Creating BST, Inserting Nodes, Deleting Nodes, Finding height, Successor Node, Max and Min in BST, Counting Nodes in BST, Printing the full tree'

Thank you.
